# protopad
Prototyping and idea pad in prep for a more real game.

Needs a rewrite for collaboration and use of Phaser's tilemaps, plus fixing a few major bugs apparently...

## Setup

Should just need to download and open the index.html in a web browser.

## Usage

Click on the map to place a tile.
Click a button on the left to change the tile type being placed.
Click a button on the right to toggle between tile and food availability views.
